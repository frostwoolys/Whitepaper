FROLY Auto-Download (Root PDF Version)
======================================
Files:
- index.html      -> Linktree-like landing with 'Auto Download Whitepaper' button (root path)
- download.html   -> Auto triggers download on load; ideal as Linktree destination
- Whitepaper.pdf  -> Your PDF in root (already included if you had uploaded it)
- README.txt

How to use (GitHub Pages):
1) Create a public repo and upload all files to the root (index.html, download.html, Whitepaper.pdf).
2) Enable GitHub Pages: Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from branch (main / root).
3) Use:
   - Landing: https://username.github.io/<repo>/
   - Auto-download: https://username.github.io/<repo>/download.html
4) In Linktree, point your button to the Auto-download URL above.
